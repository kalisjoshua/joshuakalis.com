I would create a way for each page to call a builder script that would allow all source files to be plain HTML. This way the pages that would be edited would be simple to understand and therefore maintain; and the site would also have some power to handle: master template for site layout, CSS (w/variables) minification, HTML5 semantics, jQuery effects, and other stuff."
