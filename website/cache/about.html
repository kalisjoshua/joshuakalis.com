        	<p>Presently I am employed at Michigan State Universityâ€™s Academic Information Services (AIS) in East Lansing, Michigan. At AIS we build a multitude of applications ranging from very small and specific with only a few users, to the very large where almost anyone associated with the university will at one time or another have need of it. All aspects of the University are being impacted by the redevelopment of core applications that range from student records and scholarships to payroll and research projects.</p>
	<p>I enjoy the privilege of working as a part of a team whose job it is to evaluate the aging applications, meet with their owners and/or users, and then rewriting those applications into new technologies; ASP to Java conversions for the most part. My team and I are embracing the Agile methodology in an attempt to facilitate the efforts between groups of disconnected development circles and our clients.</p>
	<p>Personally I have taken upon myself the task of educating my fellow team members in the benefits of: semantic markup, separation of content from style and interaction, as well as best practices of usability &amp; accessibility. The later, conveniently for me, has been set as a University-wide requirement for all web applications, public and private, produced by the University.</p>
	<p>Previous to AIS I worked for a much smaller unit, the International Business Center, within the Eli Broad College of Business at MSU. The environment was different than that of AIS: a very small team of people, only two programmers, and different projects all in development at the same time with short timelines. I originally was hired in as a student worker doing graphics for various promotions and advertisements. Slowly I taught myself programming (ASP) and web design (HTML/CSS), eventually becoming the only JavaScript developer and senior database programmer (SQL Server 2000).</p>
