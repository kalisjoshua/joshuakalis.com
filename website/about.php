<p>The web is where I work; I love developing on a platform that is so available and wonderfully dynamic.</p>
<p>HTML5 and JavaScript are going to change, in a big way, how we interact with information on the web. For a long time we have been held back by limitations inherent in archaic technologies and terrible formats (i.e. Flash).</p>
<p>I enjoy creating. This has been the common thread throughout all of my working history. I've been a: carpenter, cook, designer, developer, landscaper, machinist, programmer, and student (in alphabetic order).</p>
<p>My primary passion right now is JavaScript and User Interfaces. Early on I found a love for forms markup and processing; in particular it was the interaction of user and the application. The various form elements were, at times, limiting but in the end had to do the job and now with JavaScript the options are becoming more varied. Data-entry can now be extremely responsive, and even fun.</p>
<p>Even beyond data-entry, the display and organization of data is evolving with new technologies and techniques. Dynamic data, graphs with layers of information, mash-ups between disconnected data-sets; these are enabling quicker analysis of data that used to be tied to a single system and are now open on the web to everyone in as many ways as can be imagined.</p>
